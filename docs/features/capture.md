# Capture (phone viewfinder)

The Shoot tab (`apps/mobile/src/screens/Viewfinder.tsx`) is a viewfinder for a cinema camera: the phone camera preview with the frame of the chosen rig + lens drawn on top.

## Rigs and lenses

- **Rigs** (presets) are a camera body + recording format + speedbooster, or a custom sensor. Bodies and formats are in `packages/fov-math/src/cameras.ts`: BMPCC 4K/6K, generic FF, S35, APS-C, MFT, 1".
  - Optionally a lens range, e.g. an 18–35 zoom.
  - Shoot → Rig opens the **Rig sheet** (`components/RigSheet.tsx`): tap a rig to shoot with it. "Edit <rig>" and "New rig" open the **Rig editor** (`screens/Rigs.tsx`). The editor has:
    - body + format as rows that open option sheets, or a custom sensor
    - speedbooster (none, ×0.71, ×0.64, ×0.58, other)
    - an optional lens range
    - a live facts line (crop, FF-equivalent)
  - Setup → Rigs & lenses lists every rig with the same editor. The dashboard has Library › Rigs.
  - Rigs live on the server. `src/rigs.ts` holds them and the one in use for every screen, saves locally first, and pushes. `presetSync.ts` pushes offline edits and pulls the list.
- **Lens**: the **lens strip** (`LensStrip.tsx`) is a scrollable row of `LENS_PRESETS_MM` (12–135 mm) inside the rig's range (`lens.ts`).
  - Tap a value to use it. The selected one is an accent pill with "mm"; tapping it opens the **Lens sheet**, which takes any focal length (auto-focused number field plus the range presets; "Use 32 mm").
  - A value outside the rig's range is allowed there and shows struck through on the strip.
- **Math** (`packages/fov-math/src/fov.ts`, `apps/mobile/src/framing.ts`):
  - Effective focal length = lens × speedbooster; the crop factor is by diagonal against 36×24; the FOV is computed per axis.
  - The phone's own FOV comes from its 35 mm-equivalent focal length, set in Setup (Motorola Edge 50 Pro, default 25 mm, `phone.ts`).
  - The frame size is the ratio of tan(fov/2) values.
  - When the rig sees more than the phone, the live image is shrunk and the frame drawn dashed.

## Controls

**One control row**, icons only (the accessible name carries the label): **Uploads · Seq · Light · Shutter · Fit · Human · Rig**, left to right, under the lens strip. Each side control is a whole-cell target with a 46 × 56 visual; the shutter is 76 dp.

In landscape the row becomes an 80 dp column next to the tab bar, read top to bottom as Rig · Human · Fit · Shutter · Light · Seq · Uploads. The lens strip becomes an 80 dp column on the other side, after the 32 dp cutout clearance. All chrome is opaque; a control that is on is filled with the accent colour.

| Control | What |
| --- | --- |
| Uploads | Queue count as a badge (red when a shot is stuck). Tap retries everything, stuck shots included, and says what happened; **hold** (500 ms) opens the Uploads screen. |
| Seq | Sequence mode on/off. Disabled while a capture runs. The count is on the shutter disc and the SEQ badge. |
| Light | Flashlight on/off (`CameraView enableTorch`). Manual, not a flash; not remembered across launches. |
| Shutter | Capture. Red ring and disc with the photo count while a sequence runs. Dashed when it can't fire (no project, rig or camera). |
| Fit | Digital zoom so the rig frame fills the screen |
| Human | Cyan reference frame for roughly what a person sees, labelled "HUMAN 43". Setup → Viewfinder: **cycle** (off → 35 → 43 → 50 → off) or **toggle** (off ↔ the chosen value). |
| Rig | The Rig sheet |

**HUD**: solid chips over the image, top left (centred between the columns in landscape). Each is switched on its own in Setup → Viewfinder (`settings.hudChips`):
- **Project**: tap opens the Project sheet.
- **Rig and lens**.
- **FOV**: FF-equivalent and angle of view, with the fit zoom, plus the human-view relation.
- **GPS**: the mode and accuracy ("GPS ±5 m", "GPS low ±40 m", "GPS off"); see [positions](positions.md).
- **Warnings**, shown independently of the others:
  - red "No project" (tap to pick)
  - amber: no GPS fix, or worse than ±20 m in high precision (never in GPS off), rig wider than the phone, not signed in (tap to sign in), no server in this build

There is no theme button on the HUD any more; the theme is Setup → Theme.

**Blocking states** get an opaque card over the image with the one action that fixes them: "Set up a rig" → Rig editor, "No project" → Project sheet.

Setup → Viewfinder / Capture / Phone calibration hold the rest: frame colour and width, blackout and its tint (the neutral 62 % black is the default), rig orientation, orientation lock, the phone's focal length ([phone app](phone-app.md)).

## What a capture produces

`takePictureAsync` and the position (per the GPS mode, [positions](positions.md)) run in parallel. The photo is resized to 1280 px JPEG (the full-size temp file is deleted) and gets `PhotoMetadata`: id, ordinal, timestamp (the capture time), lat/lon, accuracy, lens, preset id, size, the `framing` snapshot and `device` (incl. `gps_mode` and `gps_from_first_photo`; [data model](../data-model.md)). Without any fix the photo is kept without a position ("No GPS fix · saved without position"); a capture is never refused for GPS.

It then becomes a **draft** (`CaptureDraft = { shotId, photos: DraftPhoto[] }`), with its photos moved into `draft-photos/` (`sequence.ts`, `keepPhoto`):
- **Normal:** the **Tag** screen (`screens/Tag.tsx`) opens full screen, without the tab bar:
  - the photo (fit mode) with the capture facts in the header
  - the tag editor: name (not auto-focused), INT/EXT and light in place, then location, weather and the project's extra fields as rows that open sheets
  - **Discard | Upload** pinned at the thumb (a right-hand column in landscape; for sequences "Discard 7 | Upload 7 photos")
  - Remembered tags: location, INT/EXT, light, weather and extra fields come from the last upload (`lastTags.v1`; extra fields only in the same project) and carry a **LAST** tag until changed. The name never does, so a repeat shot is one tap on Upload.
  - Upload queues and returns to Shoot with "Queued · <name>". Discard and Android back ask first (a confirm sheet); nothing is dropped silently.
- **Direct upload** (Setup → Capture): no Tag screen; the shot is queued untagged ("Queued untagged · tag it later in Review"). If queuing fails, Tag opens instead.
- **Sequence mode:** every capture while Seq is on is appended to one shot (`addToSequence`). A red "SEQ · n" badge with a dot sits on the preview. Turning Seq off turns the set into one draft: Tag (with a photo strip), or the queue with direct upload.

Drafts and running sequences are stored in the kv-store (`captureDraft.v1`, `sequence.v1`), so an app kill loses nothing: Tag or the sequence comes back on the next launch (Tag once the sign-in and project gates are through). A capture that finishes after Seq was switched off becomes a single shot, never part of the ended sequence.

## Upload queue (`apps/mobile/src/uploads.ts`)

- `enqueue` copies the photos to `pending-photos/` and stores the entry (`pendingUploads.v2`). It then deletes the draft files.
- **Queued shots are visible right away**: in Shots (filter **Queued**, and in All with a "Queued" tag on the card) and in Review, with their local photos. They can be tagged, approved, archived, positioned or discarded before they upload; the change rewrites the queue entry (`localShots.ts`), and the decision travels with the upload (`state` in the metadata). Once the first part was sent (`sent`), a later change sets `editedAfterSend` and the upload ends with a PATCH (the server keeps the tags of an existing shot). That PATCH can't make a shot stuck: when rejected it retries without the extra fields, then leaves the tags as uploaded (logged).
- After the upload the server's copy replaces the queued one in the lists at once (`onUploaded`), so nothing blinks out, and the shot is recorded for the **Uploaded · last 7 days** list (`uploadHistory.v1`).
- **Offline mode** (Setup → Offline): `flush()` does nothing and the API makes no request until it is switched off; switching it off flushes and reloads.
- `flush()`: syncs projects, field definitions and locations, then uploads oldest first, then sends edits kept on the phone (`flushEdits`, see [offline](day-mode-offline.md)). Big sequences go 12 photos per request (the server appends to the same shot). The shutter never waits for it.
- **Network or auth errors** stop the round; it is retried at the next capture, sign-in, app start or manual retry.
- **Rejections (4xx)** increase `attempts`. After 3 the entry is `stuck`: skipped automatically, listed on the Uploads screen with the error, and retried or discarded by hand. Files are never deleted for a rejection.
- **A missing photo file** means the remaining photos are uploaded and the missing ones dropped.
- `usePendingCount()` (storage.ts), `onFlushed()` and `onFlushProgress()` (the shot and photo being sent) let screens react; `useSync()` (`sync.ts`) turns them into the header's sync state.
