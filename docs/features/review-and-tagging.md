# Review and tagging

## Tags on a shot

All optional, editable at any time (`PATCH /api/shots/:id`). The vocabularies are in `packages/vocab/src/vocab.ts`.

| Tag | Values |
| --- | --- |
| Name | free text, max 120 |
| Location | a shared named place (no district); created from the tag form by typing a new name |
| INT/EXT | `int`, `ext` |
| Light | any subset of `dawn`, `day`, `dusk`, `night`: every phase the shot works in. Plus the separate **Artificial** flag (lit artificially, independent of INT/EXT; an INT shot looking out of a window can still need dusk). No phase set means any time works. Display via `lightLabel()`, e.g. "Dusk / Night + Artificial". |
| Weather | `none, sunny, partly_cloudy, cloudy, rainy, stormy, foggy, snow` |
| Shot size | one of `ews, ws, mws, ms, mcu, cu, ecu` (Extreme wide … Extreme close-up; lists show the abbreviation) |
| Camera support | one of `static` (locked-off) `, handheld, steadicam, gimbal, dolly, slider, crane` (jib) `, drone, vehicle` (mount) |
| Movement | any subset of `pan, tilt, push_in, pull_out, tracking, pedestal` (boom) `, orbit, zoom`. Support and movement are separate on purpose: a Steadicam shot can pan and push in. `cameraLabel()` gives "WS · Steadicam · Pan / Push in". |
| Extra | the project's [extra fields](extra-fields.md) |

The light model feeds the [schedule](schedule.md): phases are defined by sun elevation.

## Review workspace (dashboard)

Reviewing is finding the shots that carry a sequence, so Review (`Review.tsx`, route `#/review/<timelineId>`, issue #31) is **timeline-first**: the selected cut on stage, the project's shots in a browser beside it. Metadata work stays in the Shots tab's inspector. The stage, strip, clip panel and autosave are the [timeline](timeline.md)'s, shared via `TimelineParts.tsx`; the Timeline page keeps editing the same cuts without the browser.

- **URL**: the playhead and the open inline tool are in the URL (`?t=12.5&tool=reframe`), so a reload or a shared link lands on the same spot with the tool open ([dashboard](dashboard.md)).
- **Left**: the project's timelines (the rail collapses); **New** (`⇧N`); right-click for Rename, Duplicate (copies the clips' own drawings too), Delete. "All projects" cannot review: pick a project first.
- **Middle**: the timeline's name, length, **presentation lock** (one mode for every clip; the clip panel's presentation controls are inert while locked) and save state, the preview with transport (`Space`, ←/→, `Home`/`End`), and the strip — drag along its ruler to **scrub**. **Placeholder** (`P`) appends a placeholder clip.
- **Right** (a resizable drawer): the **shot browser** (`N` toggles it against the clip panel), or the **clip inspector** for the selected clip. Its tools edit the clip **inline on the stage**, timeline-scoped: **Re-frame** (`R`), **Overlay** (`C`), and for a placeholder **Sketch it** (`C`). See [timeline](timeline.md) → Inline editing and Timeline-scoped edits.
- **Shot browser**: cards (cover in the global frame mode, SEQ · n on sequences top left like the gallery, state marker top right, name, location · photos · overlays), two per row or **one per row** for bigger covers (the switch in the head), filtered by state ("To review + Approved" by default), location, **timeline** (in this timeline or not) and a search field, newest first. The layout and filters are remembered per browser (`localStorage["reviewBrowser"]`), so they survive leaving Review; a remembered location of another project shows as All locations.
- **In this timeline** (issue #35): a badge next to the state marker (top right) marks the shots the cut on stage uses, with "×n" when it is used more than once (a sequence block counts once). A shot counts when any clip uses it: a clip of any of its photos (with or without an overlay) or a sketch clip showing one of its sketches. Clicking the badge selects the shot's first clip (a block's first) in the strip, and each further click the next use; the browser stays open. "New shot" opens the [New shot](new-shot.md) dialog. Click selects (`A` approve / `E` archive then act on it, with an Undo toast), double-click opens the shot view, the card's foot always shows the two decisions the shot is not in (Approve green, Archive / Back to review grey), right-click offers Add to timeline, Approve/Archive/Back to review, Open shot, Show on map.
- **Drag and drop**: drag a card into the strip (an accent line marks the insert position, never inside a sequence block; a sequence comes in as a [block](timeline.md)) or **onto a placeholder** to fill it — the hold time and notes stay; a sequence fills it as a block split across that time. Dropping an unreviewed shot offers "Approve" in a toast: it earned its place. Clips reorder by drag too.
- Right-clicking a clip offers Re-frame, Overlay (or Sketch it / Edit the sketch), the decisions for the clip's shot (**Approve**, **Archive**, **Back to review**: the two it is not in, with Undo in the toast), Open shot, Duplicate, Remove. The clip panel shows the shot's state with the same decisions, and every photo clip in the strip carries a small state marker, so what in the cut is still unreviewed shows at a glance. No keys for clip decisions yet (`A`/`E` act on the browser's selection; see #32).
- A shot dropped onto a sketch clip fills it; the clip keeps the sketch and offers **Attach to shot**.

There is no stepper queue any more; the browser's state filter is the queue. The sidebar still counts unreviewed shots.

## Shot view (dashboard)

The shot view (`ShotView.tsx`) replaces the old dialog. It covers the main area (the sidebar keeps its collapsed or expanded state) and keeps the list it was opened from, from Shots, the map, Plan, Review, Timeline or ⌘K.

- **Toolbar**: back (Esc) to where it was opened from, "7 of 212" with the list's description (state · view or project · sort), and ←/→; the **stage switch** Photo · Framing (`R`) · Compose (`C`) · Position, and the frame-mode switch (hidden in Compose, where the overlay's own presentation applies). The frame mode starts from the global mode; a change sticks for ←/→ until the view closes (`viewMode` in `App.tsx`). `M` cycles it.
- **Stage**:
  - **Photo**: the photo as large as fits, with prev/next buttons beside it and nothing drawn over the picture (rig and lens are in the inspector). The foot has the photo strip for sequences (`,` `.`) and the actions Download crop (cropped in the browser), Original, Show on map, and Delete (confirm dialog, offering Archive instead).
  - **Framing**: re-frame the photo, saved framings, the root frame ([framing](rig-explorer.md)).
  - **Compose**: overlays and sketches ([compose](compose.md)); the inspector is replaced by the compose panel.
  - **Position**: the [position correction](positions.md) map.
- **Inspector** (`Inspector.tsx`, 380 px, scrolls on its own):
  - the name, state marker and a summary line
  - the decision buttons: unreviewed → Approve (`A`) · Archive (`E`); approved → Back to review · Archive; archived → Back to review · Approve. A toast confirms, with **Undo**.
  - **Tags**, edited in place and **saved per change**, with a status (Saving… · Saved · Not saved + Retry):
    - Project: a combobox; "Create “…”" makes a new project and moves the shot there (an existing name is taken, not duplicated). When moving the shot would take it off shooting days, a warning names how many, and Move confirms.
    - Name: saved on Enter or leaving the field; Esc reverts.
    - Location: a combobox, "Create “…”" makes a new one.
    - INT/EXT: INT · EXT · –.
    - Light: chips plus Artificial.
    - Weather: a combobox.
    - Shot size and Support: comboboxes; Movement: chips (any number).
    - Extra fields: saved 0.7 s after the last change.
  - **Description**: a Markdown field ([compose](compose.md)), saved 0.7 s after the last edit or on leaving it.
  - **Compose**: the names of the shot's overlays and sketches, with Open (`C`).
  - **Position** of the photo on stage, with "Correct", and the switch "Use the location's position" ([positions](positions.md)). A photo captured without GPS says "No position · captured without GPS" and offers "Set position" (the same map stage, starting at another photo of the shot or Berlin).
  - **Shot**: captured, photos, uploaded, the **shooting days** it is planned on (link to Plan) and the **timelines** it is cut into (link to Timeline).
  - **Camera** of the photo on stage: rig, the frame shown (root framing or As captured, and how many framings), body, format, sensor, lens + FF-equivalent, FOV, time, GPS accuracy, fix age and altitude, phone.
  - **Raw metadata**: collapsed, with Copy.
## Review on the phone

The **Review** tab (`screens/Review.tsx`) is a stepper queue (unreviewed, queued shots included, newest first; the header button switches to oldest first and starts at the top of that order, remembered in `reviewOrder.v1`; no skip), photo first, with the decision at the thumb:
- The photo spans the width (up to 262 dp), with the SEQ badge and "Photo i / n" for sequences and the photo strip under it. **Swipe** on the photo = next/prev shot; the strip moves between photos. **Double-tap** opens the photo full screen (mode switch on an opaque card; swipe = photos).
- The frame-view switch (remembered in `reviewMode.v1`).
- The summary:
  - the name (or the rig when untagged), the state and location
  - the tags line and the extra fields
  - rig · lens · capture time
  - **Edit** (pencil) opens the edit sheet: the same tag editor as after a capture, Save pinned; a failure keeps the sheet open with the error.
  - **⋯** opens Shot details, Show on map, Correct position and Delete (a confirm with **Archive** as the safe alternative).
- **Pinned**: Prev · "n of m" (with the order under it) · Next, then **Archive | Approve**. A decision shows "Approved · Undo" (4 s); the next shot takes the same position.
- States: skeleton while loading; "Nothing to review" with the project's totals and **Browse shots**; a load error with Try again (pull to refresh too). Offline: the banner; decisions and edits still work and are kept on the phone until they can be sent ([offline](day-mode-offline.md)).
- Landscape: the photo fills the left with the mode switch floating on it; a 292 dp side panel holds the strip, the summary and the decisions at the bottom.

**Shot details** (Shots → a shot, or ⋯ → Shot details; `screens/ShotDetails.tsx`) is a full screen:
- the photo (swipe = the neighbours in the list it was opened from), strip and frame view
- the summary, the **description** (when set) and the **overlays · sketches** strip ([compose](compose.md)), **Tags** with Edit, **Position** per photo (coordinates, ±accuracy or "corrected") with Show on map and Correct, **Camera** per photo, and **Raw metadata** (expands)
- ⋯ holds Delete (Discard for a queued shot; deleting an uploaded shot needs a connection)
- Pinned: the two states that aren't the current one (unreviewed → Archive | Approve; approved → Back to review | Archive; archived → Back to review | Approve)

## Buttons ([design](../design.md))

- Action buttons are rounded rectangles and carry an icon.
- Tabs, segmented switches and chips are pills; the selected one is filled, bold and checked.
- Approve is green. Archive and Back to review are neutral grey with a border. Secondary actions are outlined. Delete is a red outline (solid red only inside a confirmation).
- Mobile `Button` kinds: `primary | approve | archive | secondary | ghost | danger | dangerSolid` (solid red only inside a confirm sheet).

## Tag editing UI

- **Dashboard**: the inspector (above). The combobox (`ui/Combobox.tsx`):
  - Type to filter; matches at the start rank first. The typed text is marked in yellow in each match (also in ⌘K).
  - The list takes the width of its options; when that would spill past the right edge of its panel, it opens from the input's right edge.
  - ↑/↓ move, Enter or Tab take the highlighted entry (Tab also moves on), Esc cancels.
  - "Create “…”" makes a new location.
  - The same combobox is used for the project box, rig and format pickers, and the filter builder's single values.
- **Phone** (`components/TagEditor.tsx`, one editor for Tag, the Review edit sheet and the Shot-details edit):
  - Name, INT/EXT (segmented) and light (chips + Artificial) are edited in place.
  - A **Camera** section: Shot size and Camera support are rows that open a sheet (support carries LAST: it usually stays for a while; size and movement are not remembered), Movement is chips (any number).
  - Location, weather and every extra field are 64 dp rows (`FieldRow`) showing the value, the LAST tag (kept from the last capture) and a chevron; a tap opens a focused sheet:
    - **Location**: search auto-focused; "Create “…”" first when the name is new; with an empty query the last used first, then by shots there.
    - **Weather**: a 2-column grid.
    - **Extra fields**: `OptionSheet` (chips up to 12 options, a search list above, checkboxes + "Done (n)" when several are allowed); numbers and text in their own sheet; booleans as a switch row.
  - Groups expand in place (20 dp indent per level); a filled group starts collapsed showing its summary.
  - A dependent select that a parent change cleared shows "Pick again" until chosen.

## View modes (how the rig frame is drawn on a photo)

`mask` (neutral dark mask outside the frame), `frame` (border only), `fit` (crop to exactly the frame), `raw`.

- **Fit** always shows exactly the rig frame. Where the rig saw more than the phone (fraction > 1) the rest stays black, like the live view (`frameLayout` in `apps/dashboard/src/format.ts`, `FramedImage.tsx` on the phone).
- **Dashboard**: the Shots toolbar switch sets the global mode (`localStorage["maskMode"]`) for the grid, list, map, Plan and Review-browser thumbnails. The shot view has its own switch (above).
- **Phone**: Review, Shots (shared by grid and map) and step-through remember their own mode (`reviewMode.v1`, `shotsMode.v1`, `stepMode.v1`); Shot details starts from the Shots mode.
