# Day mode and offline days (phone)

The **Day** tab (`apps/mobile/src/screens/Day.tsx`, step-through in `StepThrough.tsx`) is for the shooting day itself, with the phone mounted on the camera. It opens on today when a day is planned for today.

## Flow

1. **Days list**: the active project's shooting days from `GET /api/days` (planned in the dashboard [Plan](schedule.md)), as Upcoming and Past (dimmed). Pull to refresh.
   - Each row has a date block (accent with a TODAY tag for today), the title, shots · locations, and the offline state: Online only · Saving n / m · Offline · up to date · Offline copy out of date.
   - Long-press a row: make (or update) it offline.
2. **Day overview**: header with back, the date and shot count.
   - "Now: dusk until 19:06" on today (otherwise the day's dawn and dusk times).
   - The **daylight timeline**: phases with icons, the day's shootable windows as a green band under it, a now marker on today.
   - Sunrise/sunset, the notes.
   - The **offline control** (below).
   - Shots grouped by location in plan order: each group shows its combined window; each row shows a fit thumbnail, the name, the light requirement and the planned time (red with "outside window" when it falls outside).
   - Tap a row to step through from it, or "Start from the first shot" (pinned).
3. **Step-through**: immersive (no tab bar, no header, status bar hidden, the screen kept on with `expo-keep-awake`).
   - Landscape: **Prev** as a 96 dp column at the left thumb, **Next** as a 112 dp accent column at the right thumb; both are disabled (dashed) at the ends.
   - The photo (fit mode by default; the mode is in the Details sheet and remembered in `stepMode.v1`) with a "3 / 9" badge. Sequences have a "Photo 2 / 5 ›" button that cycles. Swipe on the photo = prev/next shot.
   - The info panel: name, location, planned time, window and light requirement (green, or red with an alert when the plan falls outside).
   - Portrait: the photo on top, the info below, and Prev | Next as a 120 dp bar at the bottom (1 : 1.4).
   - **Details** (ⓘ sheet): planned time and window, location, tags, rig, extra fields, the planned shot's notes, the shot's description and a row per overlay and sketch (tap = full-screen viewer, [compose](compose.md)), the frame mode, Show on map (online only), Leave step-through. Android back also leaves.

Light is computed on the phone (`@fielder/vocab` `dayLight`), so it works offline.

## Offline

- **Make offline** (the overview's control, or long-press in the list) stores the day and its shots with all metadata, and downloads every photo and every overlay/sketch render to `Documents/offline-photos/` (`apps/mobile/src/offline.ts`, `File.downloadFileAsync` with the auth header; renders as `r-<id>-<version>.jpg`, older versions replaced). The control shows:
  - progress (n / m photos) while it runs; the rest of the screen stays usable
  - "Offline · up to date" with **Remove** (photos shared with another offline day stay; Remove confirms)
  - "Offline copy out of date" with **Update offline** when the plan changed on the server (`updated_at` differs)
  - "Saving stopped at n / m" with **Try again** when a download failed
- Without a connection (the days request fails) the tab shows only the days saved on the phone, with the offline banner, and their stored shots. Step-through needs nothing from the network.
- `ShotFrame` (every photo on the phone) uses the local copy when one exists. The Shots grid falls back to the shots of offline days when the server can't be reached.
- Capturing works offline anyway: shots queue ([capture](capture.md)). Projects and extra-field definitions are cached, so tagging works too. Map tiles are **not** cached; maps show "Map needs a connection".

Storage: kv key `offlineDays.v1` (day id → `{ day, shots, projectName, savedAt }`).

## Offline project and offline mode (Setup → Offline, `screens/Offline.tsx`)

- **Offline mode** (a switch, `settings.offlineMode`): the app makes no request at all (`net.ts` `setOfflineMode`, checked in `api.ts`), photos load only from the phone, and the header banner says "Offline mode". Captures, decisions and edits wait on the phone. Switching it off flushes and reloads.
- **Waiting on this phone**: shots to upload and edited shots to sync, with Open Uploads.
- **Keep <project> on this phone** (`offline.ts` `saveProjectOffline`): stores every shot of the active project and downloads every photo (and render) into the same `offline-photos/` folder as offline days (an estimate is shown first, about 250 KB a photo). While online, every load of the project's shots refreshes the copy in the background (new photos only; photos of shots that left the project are deleted unless a day uses them). **Update now** and **Remove** (confirms; photos of offline days stay). Storage: `offlineProjects.v1` (project id → `{ shots, projectName, savedAt, bytes }`).
- **What the tabs show** (`useShots` in `shots.ts`): the server's list, or without a connection the offline project copy (else the shots of offline days), plus the queued shots, with edits still waiting applied on top. Shots shows "Showing what is on this phone" then.
- **Edits without a connection** (`localShots.ts`): a decision, tag edit or position on an uploaded shot is tried on the server; on a network error (or in offline mode, or when older edits of the shot still wait) it is kept in `pendingEdits.v1` and shown at once ("· syncs when online"). `flush()` sends them in order after the uploads; one the server rejects is dropped and logged, a network error keeps the rest. A location created meanwhile is created first (and remapped on a name clash). Deleting an uploaded shot needs a connection (Archive works offline).
