# Timeline

Second half of [GitHub issue #12](https://github.com/bubulux/fielder/issues/12). A **timeline** is a rough cut of a project out of its scouted photos: clips in order, each with a hold time ("Vorstopp"), played back to see which shots carry a sequence. Dashboard only; the phone does not read timelines. The [Review workspace](review-and-tagging.md) edits the same timelines with a shot browser beside them (issue #31).

## Model

A project has any number of named timelines. A **clip** holds:
- one **photo** (of a shot in the project); a sequence contributes one clip per photo, so each photo gets its own hold time
- optionally one **overlay** of that photo ([compose](compose.md)): the clip then shows the overlay's render instead of the photo
- a **presentation** (frame mode plus the rig frame, the same shape as an overlay's), so the same photo can appear raw, framed or fitted, with any rig and lens
- `duration_ms` (100 ms .. 1 h), entered in seconds with one decimal
- notes

The timeline can **lock a presentation mode** (`lock_mode`): every clip then shows in that mode, in the preview, strip and clip panel, and the clip's own presentation controls are inert (its stored presentation is kept and returns on unlock).

A **placeholder** clip (issue #31) has no photo: it reserves time for a shot that does not exist yet, carrying a title ("Wanted shot"), the hold time and notes. It renders as a dashed block in the strip and the preview, plays like any clip, and is filled by dropping a shot onto it (the hold time is kept). A placeholder with a sketch is a **sketch clip**: "Sketch it" draws the wanted shot right on the stage.

### Timeline-scoped edits (issue #31)

Changes made to a clip in the timeline belong to the timeline, like in a video editor; the shot is only touched when an edit is **promoted**:
- **Re-frame**: the clip's own presentation gets the frame (rig + lens give the size, the drag gives the centre; no saved framing on the photo). The clip panel marks it "This clip's own re-frame".
- **Overlay**: drawn inline, it belongs to the clip (`overlays.timeline_id` + `clip_id`). Editing a *shot* overlay inline edits a copy for the clip; the shot keeps its own. "Show as" lists the clip's own overlays and the shot's.
- **Sketch**: a sketch clip's sketch belongs to the clip. When a shot fills a sketch clip the clip keeps the sketch; its panel then offers **Attach to shot** (the sketch becomes that shot's).
- Promotion of re-frames and overlays is in the shot view (Framing / Compose → **From timelines**, see [framing](rig-explorer.md) and [compose](compose.md)). Shots never show clip-owned overlays or sketches, and the phone never sees them.
- **Duplicate** (a clip or a whole timeline) copies the clip's own overlay and sketch, so the copies never share a drawing. Removing a clip deletes them.

The same photo can be in a timeline several times. Deleting a shot removes its clips everywhere (the shot's delete dialog says "Used in n timelines"); deleting an overlay keeps the clip, which then shows the photo as is. A shot moved to another project leaves that project's timelines, like it leaves its shooting days.

## Using it (`apps/dashboard/src/Timeline.tsx`, route `#/timeline/<id>`)

- **Left**: the project's timelines with length and clip count; **New** (`⇧N`) makes "Cut n". The rail **collapses** to a strip of numbered buttons (remembered). "All projects" cannot cut: pick a project first.
- **Head**: name, total length, the **Presentation lock** ("Per clip" or one mode for all), save status, menu (Delete timeline…). Changes **autosave** 600 ms after the last edit and at once when leaving the page; the server's answer replaces the clip list, so clips of deleted photos disappear on the next save.
- **Preview**: the selected clip, large, in its presentation (the overlay's render when one is chosen; a sketch clip's sketch on white). The stage keeps **one height** for every clip (`--tl-stage-h`): shots, sketches and placeholders letterbox into it, so the layout never jumps. The grip under the stage **resizes** it (remembered per browser in `localStorage["timelineStageH"]`; double-click goes back to the default, which fills the window). Transport: first · previous · **Play/Pause** (`Space`) · next · last, the playhead clock over the total, "clip n of m · 3.0 s", and **Add shots** (`N`).
  Playback steps through the clips at their hold times (100 ms ticks) and stops at the end; Play at the end starts over.
- **Strip**: one block per clip, its width proportional to the hold time (44 px a second, at least 64 px), with a thumbnail, the shot's title (and photo number for sequences; a layers icon marks an overlay), the hold time, and a red playhead on the current clip. Placeholders are dashed. A ruler marks the seconds; **dragging along the ruler scrubs** (the preview follows; playback, if running, continues from there). Click selects, double-click opens the shot view with the timeline's shots as its list. **Drag a clip** to reorder (an accent line marks the drop position); in the Review workspace shots drop in from the browser.
- **Clip panel** (right, for the selected clip; the drawer is **resizable**, its width is remembered): the clip tools **Re-frame** (`R`) and **Overlay** (`C`), see Inline editing; thumbnail, **Hold time** (−0.5 s · field · +0.5 s; `D` focuses it), **Show as** (Photo as is, or one of the photo's overlays; picking an overlay adopts the presentation it was drawn in), **Presentation** (frame mode and a **Framing**: As captured or a saved framing of the photo, see [framing](rig-explorer.md); a clip follows its framing's edits and starts on the root), notes, Move earlier/later (`Alt+←/→`), Duplicate, Open shot (`↵`), Remove (`Del`). A placeholder's panel has the wanted-shot title, **Sketch it** (`C`), hold time and notes instead; a sketch clip's shows the sketch and **Edit the sketch**.
- **Inline editing** (`ClipEditing.tsx`): the clip tools put the editor **on the stage** and the settings in the drawer. Re-frame: drag the frame on the stage, rig and lens in the drawer (⇧ + arrows nudge, ←/→ lens, "Start from" a saved framing, "Back to the root frame"). Overlay and sketch: the drawing canvas on the stage, the tool bar, look and shape sections in the drawer (the compose keys apply: V P L A R O T S E, 1–0, ⌘Z). Drawings **save on their own** 1.2 s after the last change and when the edit ends (Done or Esc); "Delete overlay…" / "Back to a placeholder…" remove the clip's own drawing. While editing, the editor owns the keys (#32 revisits this) and the playhead is **pinned** to the clip, or, with Settings → Timeline → "Leave ends the edit", selecting, stepping or scrubbing away ends the edit first.
- **Add shots** panel: the project's shots grouped by location, "Approved only" ticked by default, "Add all" per location. Each added clip starts at 3.0 s in the view's current frame mode with the rig the photo was shot with. **Placeholder** (`P`) appends a placeholder clip.
- Keys: `←/→` clip, `Home`/`End`, `Space`, `Alt+←/→`, `D`, `Del`, `N`, `P`, `R` re-frame, `C` overlay / sketch, `⇧N`, `↵`. `G T` goes to Timeline from anywhere.

The inspector's **Shot** section lists the timelines a shot is in (links).

## Storage

`timelines` + `timeline_clips` (`apps/worker/src/timelines.ts`), the clips' own overlays and sketches in `overlays` / `sketches` with `timeline_id` + `clip_id`, promotion in `promote.ts`. `PUT /api/timelines/:id` replaces the whole timeline; clips whose photo is not in the project are dropped silently, an overlay that does not belong to the clip's photo (or is another clip's) is nulled, and clips that leave take their own drawings along. See [api](../api.md) and [data model](../data-model.md).

The strip, preview, clip panel, playback and autosave live in `apps/dashboard/src/TimelineParts.tsx`, shared with the Review workspace.

## Not done

- No export (video or image sequence) and no transitions or audio: the timeline is for deciding, not for delivery.
