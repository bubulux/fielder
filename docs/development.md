# Development

Node 22 and pnpm 11 (via nvm). `pnpm install` enforces a 7-day dependency cooldown (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`). The root `Makefile` wraps the root `package.json` scripts, which stay the source of truth: `make` lists the targets.

## Checks (run before every commit)

```sh
for p in packages/vocab packages/fov-math apps/worker apps/dashboard apps/mobile; do (cd $p && npx tsc -p .); done
pnpm -C packages/vocab test        # fields, filters, daylight
pnpm -C packages/fov-math test     # FOV, overlay, reframe
(cd apps/mobile && node --test src/*.test.ts)
(cd apps/dashboard && npx vite build)
(cd apps/mobile && npx expo export --platform android --output-dir /tmp/fielder-export)   # proves Metro can bundle
```

The Worker typecheck needs `apps/worker/worker-configuration.d.ts` (gitignored): `pnpm -C apps/worker types` generates it.

## Local API + dashboard

```sh
pnpm dev:init       # once per checkout: gitignored dev files + local D1 migrations
pnpm dev            # worker on :8787 + dashboard on :5173 (proxies /api and /health to 8787)
pnpm dev:worker     # or separately
pnpm dev:dashboard
```

`dev:init` never overwrites existing files. It creates:
- `apps/worker/.dev.vars` with `ACCESS_DEV_BYPASS="true"` (every request is `dev@localhost`)
- `apps/mobile/.env.local`
- an empty `apps/dashboard/dist`: `wrangler dev` refuses to start without it

Local D1 and R2 state lives in `apps/worker/.wrangler/state` (delete it to start fresh, then `pnpm -C apps/worker migrate:local`). Local data is separate from production: say which one you mean.

API smoke tests work with plain `curl` against `localhost:8787` (no auth needed locally). Multipart uploads: `curl -F "metadata=…" -F "photo.<id>=@file.jpg;type=image/jpeg"`.

## Phone dev loop (Expo Go)

```sh
pnpm dev:mobile     # expo start --go --tunnel; reads apps/mobile/.env.local
```

- Open Expo Go and enter the `exp://….exp.direct` URL Metro prints. The tunnel is needed because WSL2 in NAT mode is not reachable from the phone over LAN.
- JS changes hot-reload. Every native module the app uses ships in Expo Go.
- The phone talks to the **deployed** Worker (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`), so Worker changes need a deploy first. Without that variable the login WebView loads `/auth/mobile` against `file://` and fails.
- A native module that Expo Go lacks means switching to a dev client: `pnpm -C apps/mobile build:dev-client` once, then `pnpm -C apps/mobile start:dev-client`.
- If the tunnel fails with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'body')`, an old ngrok session is still registered: wait 30 s or set `EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN`.
- Expo changed a lot. Read the versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/ before using an Expo API (`apps/mobile/AGENTS.md`). Example: `expo-file-system` exposes `File`/`Directory`/`Paths` with sync `copySync`, `textSync`, `write`, and `File.downloadFileAsync`.

## Deploy and migrations

Shortcuts (`make help` lists all): `make login` (wrangler, device code), `make deploy` (remote migrations, then the deploy below), `make apk-cloud` (EAS), `make apk-local` (`scripts/apk-local.sh`: the local build below, then copies `fielder-<commit>.apk` to the Windows Downloads folder; override with `DOWNLOADS=…` or `API_URL=…`).

```sh
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=3868cbc17be171c90972dd32e41e7783 pnpm -C apps/worker migrate:remote   # apply new migrations first
pnpm -C apps/worker run deploy     # builds the dashboard, deploys Worker + assets
```

- Wrangler needs a login (`npx wrangler login --device` works in WSL). The OAuth token lacks `account:read`, so set `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` when a command cannot find the account.
- The user runs production deploys themselves. AI sessions prepare the change and the migration, then ask.
- Migrations are additive: always a new numbered file.

## APK builds

Cloud: `pnpm -C apps/mobile eas build --platform android --profile apk` (EAS free plan has a monthly build quota).

Local (same keystore, fetched from Expo): `make apk-local`, in a Docker container (`docker/android.Dockerfile`: JDK 17, Android SDK 36, build-tools 36.0.0, NDK 27.1.12297006, cmake 3.22.1, Node 22.20.0, pnpm 11.13.1; nothing installed in WSL).
- Once: Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → WSL integration → enable this distro; `npx eas login` (the session in `~/.expo` is mounted into the container; `EXPO_TOKEN` works too).
- `scripts/apk-local.sh` builds the image (cached after the first run), runs `eas build --local --profile apk` with the repo mounted and Gradle's cache in the `fielder-gradle` volume, writes `~/fielder-builds/fielder-<commit>.apk` and copies it to the Windows Downloads folder.
- The app points at `https://fielder-api.fielder-worker.workers.dev` unless `API_URL=…` is set. The first run downloads the SDK and Gradle dependencies (several GB); later builds take about 10 minutes.

## Debugging on the phone

Turn on Setup → Debug log, reproduce, then share the log ([debug log](features/debug-log.md)). Worker logs: Workers observability is enabled (`wrangler.jsonc`), queryable in the Cloudflare dashboard or through the API.
