## History

- Before 2026-09-27: prototype with one shot = one photo, districts and a hard-coded U-Bahn list.
- 2026-09-27: rework from [GitHub issue #1](https://github.com/bubulux/fielder/issues/1). Schema reset to `0001_baseline.sql` (prototype data dropped), then all features above. The implementation plan is in the git history of branch `rework/phase-1-projects-photos`.
- 2026-09-28: redesign on a design system from Claude Design ([design.md](design.md)), then a ground-up rework of the dashboard and the phone screens from Claude Design ([dashboard](features/dashboard.md), [phone app](features/phone-app.md)); features unchanged.
